<img width="720" src="https://github.com/mysterymarshak/LuckyBlocks/assets/37479500/47c57c25-c8c3-44e4-9482-13684ab3f23e" alt="Lucky blocks" />

*They may be unlucky for some players*  
Â© *Old superfigher saying*

## Description

That script adds much of insteresting things.  
When a loot crate spawns on the map, there is `30%` (by default) chance that it become a lucky block  
There are a lot of different drop types you may receive:

1. [Player Buffs](#player-buffs) `(make us harder, better, faster, stronger)`
2. [Weapons](#weapons) `(as a drop or improvement)`
3. [Magic](#magic) `(wind, fire, and more...)`
4. [Items](#items) `(have you ever used expired pills?)`
5. [World Events](#world-events) `(the God of the match is watching you)`

**Recommendations**: don't use teams, scripts that can modify objects, players, basically other mods. Lucky blocks is a global standalone mod that changes the game in many aspects. [There are](https://steamcommunity.com/id/mysterymarshak/myworkshopfiles/?appid=855860) my other scripts, that can improve gameplay experience and works fine together (except BazookaGame, which is, in fact, also mod), i'm not responsible for the rest  

All not-standart textures that you will see in GIFs aren't included to this repo

## About script

This script is a script with a huge history that began in 2021, thanks to it I learned a lot in c#, even picked up linear algebra and repeated quite a bit of physics. that's hundreds of hours of code. Now I have absolutely no time left to do or change anything, this script should have been released at the end of summer - a little more than six months ago. but in three days I finally managed to finish what I had to postpone the release because of. I can now say that I like the time stopping magic and that it is done quite well. in lucky blocks, in general, no matter how hard I tried, there were always some shortcomings, for example, source generators, which I mastered in the summer, I never completed, unfortunately. many ideas had to be abandoned. but the release can no longer be delayed. I donât even know when we last played SFD, probably a very long time ago. this script is what will remain in the SFD from our creative association of ["shiza"](https://www.youtube.com/@to_shiza). I want to believe that it will bring as much fun as it did for us in its time. The script can only be seen with your eyes, I do not plan to publish a way to compile it. those who want to try - good luck, I'll be interested to see
