*They may be unlucky for some players.*  
Â© *Old superfigher saying*

## Description

This script adds many insteresting ideas to vanilla SFD.  
When a loot crate spawns on the map, there is `30%` (by default) chance for it to become a lucky block.

There are different drop types you may receive:  

1. [Player Buffs](#player-buffs) `(make us harder, better, faster, stronger)`
2. [Weapons](#weapons) `(as a drop or an improvement)`
3. [Magic](#magic) `(wind, fire, and more...)`
4. [Items](#items) `(have you ever used expired pills?)`
5. [World Events](#world-events) `(the big brother is watching you)`
6. [FAQ](#faq) `... no, you`

**About compability with other scripts**  
Lucky Blocks is a global standalone mod that changes SFD gameplay in many aspects. Only following quality of life scripts are well-tested and work fine with this script: [Loot Displayer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2545232247), [No Drones](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2250869022). Any other script or map with complicated logic may cause bugs and will not be fixed on our side.  

Every loot has `weight` attribute, equals to `1` by default.  
The higher value corresponds to higher chance to appear.  
P.S. [Bloody bath](#bloody-bath) and both of [Remove all weapons](#remove-weapons) has lower weight due to balance issues.

## Player Buffs

Player buffs somehow modify player. Most of them are obtained from lucky block (check source in description) when player breaks it by melee attack. There are buffs that are obtained when certain condition are met.  

There are next player buff types: [instant](#instant-buffs), [durable](#durable-buffs), [situational](#situational-buffs).  
 
* Instant buffs are applied once when added.  
* Durable buffs are working during some time.  
* Situational buffs... Just read their descriptions.  

Incompatible buffs are impossible to get together in the same time.

### Immunity

Some buffs may give an immunity to something (like fire, fall damage, something script-specific or etc). It ends with the buff itself (sometimes with delay).

Also some buffs may interact with others, like if you has [Wet Hands](#wet-hands), becoming [Fire Wizard](#fire-wizard) will dry them.

## F.A.Q.

**Q**: I am playing with gamepad, changed key mapping, how to use `[ALT + A]` etc.  
**A**: Actions are actually bound to events. `[ALT + A]` means you have to be in slow-walking state and pressing attack button.

**Q**: Is there any commands in script?  
**A**: Use `/lb_help`.

**Q**: Cool textures! Are they part of script? How to get them?  
**A**: Not a part of script. Meant for "shiza" internal usage only.

**Q**: Cool project! How can I build it?  
**A**: Great question! You can't! Nobody stops you from finding a way to do it though.

**Q**: Time revert works badly, what's happened to my C4? Detonator doesn't work!  
**A**: Game creators stole it :<

**Q**: Freezed player moves! HOW?!?!?  
**A**: Probably they live on south. *(unreproducible bug)*

**Q**: Does this script work with bots?  
**A**: Maybe. Better avoid them. We assumed you will play with real humans (or maybe even touch the real grass).

**Q**: Why there're exceptions or warnings in the chat?  
**A**: Shit happens. We also discovered that high ping may cause some issues. Feel free to [report](https://github.com/mysterymarshak/LuckyBlocks/issues) about bad things. In order to in-place solution you can restart the script via `/lb_restart` command.

## About script

This script is a script with a huge history that began in 2021, thanks to it I learned a lot in c#, even picked up linear algebra and repeated quite a bit of physics. that's hundreds of hours of code. Now I have absolutely no time left to do or change anything, this script should have been released at the end of summer - a little more than six months ago. but in three days I finally managed to finish what I had to postpone the release because of. I can now say that I like the time stopping magic and that it is done quite well. in lucky blocks, in general, no matter how hard I tried, there were always some shortcomings, for example, source generators, which I mastered in the summer, I never completed, unfortunately. many ideas had to be abandoned. but the release can no longer be delayed. I donât even know when we last played SFD, probably a very long time ago. this script is what will remain in the SFD from our creative association of ["shiza"](https://www.youtube.com/@to_shiza). I want to believe that it will bring as much fun as it did for us in its time. The script can only be seen with your eyes, I do not plan to publish a way to compile it. those who want to try - good luck, I'll be interested to see

I'm tired of making changes to `README.md`

New lucky blocks update brings new items, many improvements and fixes. Now script is so worked out and detailed that mentioning all small things would take a lot of time and symbols. So try it yourself, I hope you will appreciate this update. SFD hasn't seen this kinda stuff yet :>
